# 🚀 Epic road trip

![EpicRoadTrip](https://www.wikicampers.fr/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/roadtrip-%C3%A0-faire-dans-sa-vie.jpg)

So, you’re going to do it for them, through an amazing trip planner which gathers intel, and suggests events
and services!

Users enter one (or more) keywords, corresponding to a location (or elsewhere). Your app takes care of everything else and they only have to choose, chill, eat, drink, sleep, have fun...

This project is ambitious, but you’re gonna have to prove to yourselves that you can complete it entirely in
a very short time, thanks to the quality and resources that others have already put at your disposal.

If your MR does not meet the requirements above, they will not be merged and comments will be added for you to fix the line/file concerned. The easiest way to fix the issue is to checkout the concerned branch, commit your fix and push.
